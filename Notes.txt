Marketers -> Create Notification -> Sending the request to an API -> Publishes the message to the RabbitMQ Queue.
Customers -> Process these messages

Producer: Publishes the message
Consumer: Receives and processes the message
Queue: Stores messages reliably
Exchanges: Route messages to Queue - Routing Mechanism that decides how the messages published by producers should be delivered to the queue.
Acknowledgements: Ensure messages aren't lost

Decoupling Notification Sending => Async Processing, API responds immediately while the processing happens async.

Direct Exchange: Routes messages to the queues where the binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message.
FanOut Exchange: Routes messages to all the queues bound to it.
Topic Exchange: Routes messages based on the pattern matching between the routing key and the binding key.
Headers Exchange: Routes messages based upon the headers not the routing key.
